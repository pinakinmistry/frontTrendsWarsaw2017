These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> It’s not difficult to find anyone that agrees that user testing is a good idea. But it’s even easier to find people who say they don’t have the time or the budget for user testing. Ida will show you tips, tools and examples from actual projects, and demonstrate that yes, you do actually have everything you need to do user testing.

How many of you do user testing? Not much of us.

I usually ask my colleagues, but colleagues are not users. Neither do are designers. Nor developers (unless you're designing Github)

Is Hamburger icon a good idea? Survey was made in 2014. 53% didn't know in mobile, 73% no in desktop. Now it's like becoming a convention... 

But how do users use your website? 

1 in 3 problems were found by experts were false alarms. 1 out of 2 were overlooked by them (experts). 

You don't really need a lot of testers to do UT (user testing). You just need 5, to cover 85% of UX problems. With 10 people you find 95%. With 0 people, 0%.

7 low cost techniques to do UT

## 1 - Hit the streets

Cost: snacks. 

Easy. You need snacks to convince people to talk to you :) A basket of them, maybe. With your tablet in the basket behind them. Like at the central station. Go to users that are bored waiting for somebody, not the ones in a hurry. It's very important to have bananas just to convince people that are on a diet (even if they will take the chocolate after all).

Or you can use the social media, promise sweets, then go to them with the bike, and go. Screen recording, like with Quicktime on a Mac, then go to the next person.

## 2 - Information architecture

Or you can test categories asking people in what category they would search for some product.

## 3 - First click

Heat map of where users click.

## 4 - prototype meets the actual users

Share an article, put user usage analytics on it. Then see what they do.

## 5 - did you get it done?

"Was this page helpful" model. So see what pages are looking useful.

(note to self: put something like this in my blog posts. Yes -> share this. No -> give me feedback?)

## 6 - microtesting content

Print this, fold the article, ask people to read only the title and the intro, then ask to write questions of what they expect in the folded part, then read the article. This makes them go in the mind state of the content.

## 7 - Weekly drop-in test

Cost: Set up a lab, reward people.
Byt you don't need a very expensive lab, you just need google hangouts, yuo can also use an eye-tracking software through camera. 
If you test it on mobile, you can use a laptop camera turning the laptop around and making them use the mobile in front of it.

After you set up the lab, test day e.g. every wed. One persone responsivble for moderating and recruiting test subjects.Then 2-30 minutes break between each test subject to discuss what they saw. You can also have a developer change it on the fly if it's easy, so in next tests it won't be a problem anymore.

You shouldnt just use one of the 7 methods. 1, 2 and 5 maybe. Or 2, 6 and 7. Or 1 and 7 so meet actual users.
