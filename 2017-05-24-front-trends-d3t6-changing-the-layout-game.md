These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> Our demand for layout on the web has changed, we’ve moved from building a series of pages, to building interfaces out of libraries of components that we compose together. Our tools for creating layout in the past have been an exercise in hacks, magic numbers, and workarounds.
> The tools we had weren’t designed for the challenge, but we made them work. Today, we have game changers like Grid, Columns, Flexbox, and Calc. With these powerful features we’re capable of creating beautiful, flexible layouts with much more simplified code, and build out components that can independently adapt to the space in which they exist.
> In this talk, we’ll discover the possibilities these features create. We’ll explore the ResizeObserver and the first steps toward the Container Query, creating smarter components with Flexbox, managing complex layout with Grid, and using CSS Variables to help us simplify managing the layout.
