These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> It’s not difficult to find anyone that agrees that user testing is a good idea. But it’s even easier to find people who say they don’t have the time or the budget for user testing. Ida will show you tips, tools and examples from actual projects, and demonstrate that yes, you do actually have everything you need to do user testing.
