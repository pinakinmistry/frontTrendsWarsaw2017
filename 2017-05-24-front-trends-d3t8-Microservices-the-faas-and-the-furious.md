These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> Recent years have seen a shift in technical architectures. Building complex services for the web used to be just that – complex. Projects might have demanded a broad range of specialist skills which could stretch even the fullest of full-stack developers. These days we have a growing number of options for how we design, build and maintain the systems which keep our web sites and applications alive.
> This talk will look at ways to make use of readily available microservices to unlock functionality​ and opportunity in otherwise simple technical stacks. We’ll talk about the benefits in keeping your stack simple, and in leaning on the expertise of others.
