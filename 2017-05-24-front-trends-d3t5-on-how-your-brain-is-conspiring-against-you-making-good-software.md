These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> If there’s anything that decades of psychological research have shown us, it’s that human cognition is full of bias, fallacy, and error. Even us smart software engineers, who sit around and think all day, are not immune to being humans, and therefore we fall into these pitfalls too.
> In fact, there are so many ways our brains default to being lazy, which keep us from being the best developers we could be and prevent us from making the best software we could be making.
> Whether it’s thinking through those complex logical problems or planning our work effectively or being productive in our open offices or even assembling the best teams, our brains just aren’t naturally acting in our favor.
> We will will talk through pieces of psychological research in an effort to make everyone aware of how our minds work, how it’s making us all worse at tech, and what we all can do about it.
