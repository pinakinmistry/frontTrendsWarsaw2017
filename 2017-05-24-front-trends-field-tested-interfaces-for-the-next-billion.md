These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> “The next billion” is a phrase bandied around a lot these days. Connected smart phones are bringing computing and the internet to many people who are now learning to use digital interfaces for the first time – people all over the globe; from West Africa to India to Brazil. Serving these users is both an economic opportunity and an ethical imperative.
> So what does this actually mean in practice? How does someone who’s been introduced to technology through a second-hand cheap Blackberry knock-off powered by a car battery respond to these new and shiny ways of interacting with machines? What effects do unreliable power and intermittent internet have on the user experience? How can we make sure that keeping up with the cutting edge won’t alienate the people in these fast-growing emerging economies who are just starting to get into the web?
> In this talk we’ll go through examples from working with novice tech users in resource-constrained environments, and discover how they navigate apps, comprehend interfaces, input data, and understand screen flows. You’ll learn how certain UI patterns, animations, and navigation conventions hinder or help, and leave with an understanding of how to include these millions of new users in your product thinking.

Creating products for the next billion.

The next billion is the next big wave of people who s gonna come online.

In Europe we have 80% already connected. In the USA it's about 75%. In Australia 85%. In Canada 88%. 

There are lot of places where people are not online. Never filled an online form, etc.

In Mexico and Brazil, it's probably only 50% connected. Africa is around 22%. So hugely populized areas with people not online.

In Nigeria you could buy cheap second hand phones. With a data plan. A whole new world for these people.

Serving these people is the right thing to do, it's fair, it's democratic. 
And a billion new users means a potential billion clients.
It benefits everyone.

## Empathy

Principle of the design process. It should be empatic with the people we're designing for. 
But I recently read "empathy is bullshit" post. Not itself, but it can't be a replacement.

Who am I anyway?
@allyelle, product designer and front-end dev - shiny experiences

A few years ago I started working with Africa. I've been workers with donors and Unicef organization, working for public health projects.

A different kind of work. Going around, in houses, do stuff.
Part of her job is to introduce people to the technology.
Very flaxy connection and very low power.
You can't know what's like to be on a 56< or 20> connection.

## Practical tips

What's the typical african user? There isn't one. :)

### Devices

Typical devices are cheap lower devices connection. Android based. Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Samsung if fancy, Apple if reeeeealy fancy.

### Condition

Scretched screens, not good screens.

### Browsers

Opera mini is a thing. Because it's a proxy browser and saves data.

### Connectivuty

Reaaally bad. No coverage or really expensive. 

## Latency

It's fucking slow. 

### Optimize for responsive UIs

... lost it

### Difficult to charge

Finding a powering source is not always easy. Like charge it with a generator miles away.

A diesel generator takes 2 hours to charge a phone, a solar power 4-5 hours.

### Phones off 

To save data and battery life, they turn them off always.

## Touch screens are easier to use than laptops

Because
- the input is separate from the screen.

## Gestures

They aren't familiar, but you need to be very careful.

## If elements are offscreen, they're not discoverable

Form example. Bunch of fields, causes content to end below the fold. It fails.

A wizard style is better then.

## Cascade selection

Selects a cascade didn't work very well too (changing one causes resetting the others). 
Again, 3 different screens in progression.

## Proper affordance

- Things that can be pressed should look like they can be pressed.
- Make buttons like bigger and clickier, more obvious
- Clear labeling
- Combining icons and labels to tell what it does and help to remember

People would click anything to see what it does. 

An if it doesn't respond immediately, they tap it a million times.
You need a very good thorough QA to do this stuff.

Very clear modular UI.

## Animations

Animations in form elements = Sad face
Like the floating label animation.

Animations to describe spatial model = Love
Like slide back and forth to make know we're going forward.

## Consistency

A consistent UI helps people to learn and memroze

# Make it fun

Gameification give people incentives and encourages people.

# STEAL

Or borrow.

When in doubt, copy from Facebook, Whatsapp, Gmail

# PROCESS

Adjust your design / dev processes to include in-person usability testing in these markets.

Assemble a **diverse team** with **local partners**. It allows to bridge the gap in understanding.

Keep calm and just shut up when you see people acting with devices in weird ways.

Don't try to control the environment or situation

Don't taka a laptop with you. Write up your findings in a fresh way.

# CONCLUSION

Be curious
Have empathy
But do the research.

African tech consumers are demanding and informed once they become familiar with technology.

Same things that matter here matter in Africa. Communicate. Take photos. Listen music. Grow economically.

(_nda_ lost one here)

Know your users
Be curious to know the world around

The next billion is the future of the internet.
It's something we're gonna be really excited about.
