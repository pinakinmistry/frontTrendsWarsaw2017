These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> The best time to have ideas is before you know what you’re doing. The early history of the Web is full of experiments and false starts that fizzled out, but might be worth trying again. There are also some lessons about what not to do that we failed to learn from the first time. At the very least, we can inject some life into the boring, corporate, centralized Web of 2017. In this talk, we’ll roll back the stone and descend into the pyramid of the ancient web to see what treasures are worth stealing, and what booby traps are waiting to ensnare us.

There are lots of things to master to know how to web develop these days.   

Re:loading - ideas for efficient loading on the web (Medium post). 

People had the app fever, added things like parralax and beautiness but it's bloading the page of resources.

## Analogies with the radio

Radio was predicted in 1864, then came Marconi's telegraph but it was short range, nothing more than a buzz. Then devices to cover dozens of kms communicating in morse code. Huge success: boys that were staying at home speaking with friends. People started imaginating a different future, revolutioned by the radio. 

But nobody was still imaginating broadcasting. Then broadcasting came and was done by professionists, you needed a licence, etc. And then came advertising and political purposes, people rallied on the radio. And also came the idea of making fireside chat, it created an atmosphere, it explained things in human terms. People wanted to listen, they pulled over their cars, gathered in radio spots, etc.

It also revolutioned the war. It was used as weapon or propaganda. It took 3 decades to change, radio brought music in hospitals, sitting rooms, isolated countryside farms. It was created for good and made good, then it was used for the bad. 

It's happing the same with social media? People are figuring how to use them to do propaganda like brexit organizers, etc.

Google IO started to speak about AI and ? surveillance, it is making something evil? Spying us?

The choice of what you want to do mtters a lot, it will make the direction the web is taking. 

There was a time when illegal radios tried to become real, they struggled to figure out how to do it without being caught by the secred services, they managed to do it with sports baloons? Hidrogen in fire extinguishers (_nda_ for what?). .. _kinda lost him here_

## Conclusion

We need to make sure that the power doesn't get comfortable using our tools. We don't need to stop being nerds. We're the pioneers of the next world, the desiciton that we make matters.
