These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> Progressive Web Apps are all the rage these days! The technologies behind them allow you to build web apps that run really smoothly, launch really quickly, work well offline, and integrate into your OS just like your favorite native apps.
> In this fast-paced talk, weâ€™ll build a PWA from scratch and walk-through all the various pieces involved - the web app front-end, the web application manifest, service workers, and more.

Progressive web apps are apps that are: 
- secure,
- fast, 
- can sent push notifications
- can appear in the home screen with an icon, a manifest, etc.

You need a web app, https, and a service worker

Service worker is a pieace of technology, shipped in FF and Chrome, under dev in Edge, under consideration on Safari.

Smashing mag new version is featuring SW.

## You can start today

It's just a regular web app. We just... need to do progressive enhancement (browser imparities)

The web works on TVs, laptops, smartwatches, browsers, etc.

Number of devices are few but growing, that's why we call it progressive enh.

*PWA Builder* is a tool to scaffold a PWA (?)

Lighthouse by google helps you understand how's your app performing

## Beyond the browser

They blur the line between web apps and native apps

Provide better device integration - adding it to the home screen, the icon, the color, etc. comes from a manifest. Launching the app, the browser is frameless, even if it's already there.

## PWAs and Windows

We (MS?) want PWA to be native. 

It runs automatically on all your devices, including Xbox, etc.

What do you need to do? Build a PWA, and .. do nothing :)

To PWA or not?

Developer experience can be good or bad, like user experience.

We want to have a good dev experience making the best user experience. 

PWA are actually a pretty awesome solution.

PWA have the best qualities of web apps and native apps.

Instant time to market and bla bla bla

It's cross browser (kinda), so one codebase to rule them all.
