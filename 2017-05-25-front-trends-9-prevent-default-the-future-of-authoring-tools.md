These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> Today’s devices are built around the web browser and chances are good every document you share will be delivered over the web — yet our tools still enforce the limitations of paper.
> The web acts as a true equalizer crossing physical borders, walled gardens and is the purest expression of the digital medium in use today. The truly accessible, portable document format of today is the website and to fully realize the potential of this medium we need to rethink what general purpose (productivity) software for the web can be.
> In this talk we’ll start from the observation that if you strip everything away the web should reduce to plain text. Through a series of case studies we’ll examine the historical challenges and possible future of text editing on the web.

Lives in NY, grow in Romania, no internet until 2001. 
Spent a lot of time building educational tools, lot of CMS.

(talking a lot about his work, is this the point?)

So this is the future of authoring tools.

(audio incomprensibile di Steve Jobs)

Initially computers were seen as crunching numbers, office tools, not generic tools.
Typewriters started to check grammar of words
Then we arrived to document writers, then with images, etc.
Then arrived google docs, you could have a word processor on the web.
And then, dropbox paper.

The future o authoring tools is the web. We live in a connected world.

What the web is for? We like that it's beginning to be collaborative as it was initially meant to be. Web 1.0 to 2.0.

try.airtable.com - ?

The web browser as uiversal meta platform.

Computer makes human better communicators. How to empower non-technical creators?

...I'm starting to lose attention, lots of quotes, no images, white on black slides, flat voice, looking at his screen, yawn...

What do we use to author the web today?

Twitter, wordpress, tumblr, forms, etc.

ConetntEditable is at the core of both modern and older browsers, useful to enter text. But is it too complex and buggy? We try to avoid it, using IDEs or markdown.

The history of text controls.
