These are my notes from Front-trends 2017 Warsaw conference.

> During the browser wars, compatibility was a mess and so was the web. Dirty hacks, a huge pile of frustration and enormous amount of time to test through every browser were a part of our everyday life.
> Times changed. Browser wars are finally over (right?!). But the web is still broken and browsers still work in different ways.
> In this talk, weâ€™ll explore the reason for web (in)compatibility, how to fix it and how you as wcompats can help to save the world (wide web).
